# smw

Our discord server is: https://discord.gg/AJJbJAzNNJ

Early version. It has bugs and the code is messy.

For building instructions, see: https://github.com/snesrev/smw/blob/main/BUILDING.md

Put smw.sfc (sha1 hash 6b47bb75d16514b6a476aa0c73a683a2a4c18765) in the root folder. When running, it will run both versions and compare frame by frame. If it detects a mismatch, it saves a snapshot in saves/ and displays a counter on screen counting down from 300.
